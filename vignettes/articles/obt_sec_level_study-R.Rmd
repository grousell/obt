## Recoding Course Number to Level of Study
This function takes the fifth digit of the course number (ENG2D, FSF3U) and creates a vector with the level of study. 

* L = Locally Developed  
* P = Applied  
* D = Academic  
* E = Workplace  
* C = College  
* U = University  
* O = Open  
* M = University/College  
* N = Alternative Education  
* W = De-streamed


```{r sec_level}

set.seed (325)

  select (id, course_number) |> 
  mutate (level_study = obt_sec_level_study(course_number)) |> 
  slice_sample (n = 10)
