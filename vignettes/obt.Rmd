The goal of the `obt` package is to provide tools for data professionals in Ontario school boards (and elsewhere) to work with common data sets across the province. This includes:
* Report Card Data (elementary and secondary)
* EQAO Data (Primary and Junior assessments of Reading, Writing and Mathematics, Grade 9 Assessments of Mathematics and the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test)
* Ontario University Application Center (OUAC) and Ontario College Application Service (OCAS) data

```{r setup}
library(obt)
library(dplyr)
library (ggplot2)

df <- ele_rc

head (ele_rc)
```
