The goal of the `obt` package is to provide tools for data professionals in Ontario school boards (and elsewhere) to work with common data sets across the province. This includes:  
* Report Card Data (elementary and secondary)  
* EQAO Data (Primary and Junior assessments of Reading, Writing and Mathematics, Grade 9 Assessments of Mathematics and the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test) (pending)   
* Ontario University Application Center (OUAC) and Ontario College Application Service (OCAS) data (pending)  

Features of this package include re-coding report card marks to  

* Ontario achievement levels  
* At/Above Standard (e.e Level 3 or Level 4)  
* Pass/Fail  
* Alpha marks to numeric equivalent (i.e. A = 90, B- = 72, D = 55)
